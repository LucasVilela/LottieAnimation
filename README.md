# Presentation Script

Duration: 5min

1. Personal Intro
   Hi Everyone I'm Lucas and I'm a front-end dev at Innowell, today I will talk about animations, not a css animations but it is pretty cool.

2. Problem Intro
   **Animation of loading page**
   So when you look to this animation how would you approach ? Is one of the most comon problems we have to solve but as you guys can see there is a color transition some very specific design. You may have thought about svgs and css.

3. The bridge between design and development
   Designers have different tools than developers and sometimes we got caught out in the middle where we have to rededraw the specificites of a design but in code.

4. Intro to react lottie
   So Airbnb created this open source project called react-lottie where complex animations like this one can be more simple, we as developers don't touch the design instead we just implement that

5. But how that work?
   Lottie animations are created in Adobe After Effects and then covered to a Json file using a plugin called Bodymoving, I won't get into this details here but at the end I will leave all the links for you guys.

6. This JSON file is what we can use to create this animations
   **Bunch of animations**

7. And the best part is how we can manipulate this animations
   **Demo part**
   _Choose an animation and start to_
   _Change the speed_
   _Change the background_
   _Start and pause_

8. Some advatages

- Don't re create the animation in code again, is ready as the designer planned
- The full control over the animation
- The size of the files, complex animations can be less than 10kb
- The flexibility of the animations
- A huge community

9. the community
   Lottie community is actually huge, there is all types of things you can imagine here
